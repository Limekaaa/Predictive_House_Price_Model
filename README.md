## Predictive House Price Model

The "Predictive House Price Model" is a project aimed at developing an advanced machine learning model that predicts the sale prices of houses based on various input parameters.
This dataset, part of a Kaggle competition, targets individuals with some experience in R or Python and basic machine learning knowledge. Ideal for data science students who completed an online machine learning course, the competition focuses on predicting the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables covering nearly every aspect of residential properties. The dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock for data science education, serves as a modernized version of the well-known Boston Housing dataset. Participants are tasked with employing creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to predict home prices.
This is our proposition to solve the problem of the kaggle competition **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** in the best way we can. To do this we will use several techniques of Machine Learning and will be written in Python.

## Motivation

Our first motivation is that some of us have learned about machine learning theory, and now, we are enthusiastic about witnessing its application in the real world. This project serves as a practical link between theoretical understanding and real-world implementation. Therefore, we are impatient to apply the coding skills acquired in R or Python during our academic pursuits. This project provides an opportunity to translate theoretical coding knowledge into practical use, specifically in predicting house prices. Moreover, the prominence of data science in engineering, this project represents a collective effort to explore deeper into this field. It positions us to be well-prepared for roles where data plays a significant role.

## What we want to see at the end ?

The ultimate objective is to witness the practical application of our collective knowledge in addressing a real-world problem : predicting house prices. Successfully making a difference in this realm signifies the tangible impact we strive for. The project serves as a practical showcase of our understanding of machine learning theory. We anticipate a tangible manifestation of how theoretical concepts translate into real-world applications.
